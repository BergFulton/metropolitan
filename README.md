#Restoring my 1959 Nash Metropolitan Hardtop.

On August 20, 2016, I purchased a 1959 Nash Metropolitan with 55,273 miles. It had been purchased as a project car in 1974, towed from Florida...and then left unfinished in a garage. I happened to spot the car on Hemmings.com, and was immediately in love. 

I'm going to be creating an actual site for this project, but I figured a GitHub repo could be a great place to triage the problems and their timeline over the restoration period.

So please check out the [issues](https://github.com/BergFulton/metropolitan/issues), separated roughly by system to help keep them straight.
